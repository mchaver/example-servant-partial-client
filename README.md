# example-servant-partial-client

This project is a small example of how to create versioned APIs and partial
servant client implementations.

You can build and test the server and client with stack:

```
stack build
stack test example-servant-partial-client
```

You can also run the server with `stack exec example-servant-partial-client` and
test queries in a separate shell:

```
```
